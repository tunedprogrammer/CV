                <h3>Blockchain-based Document Verification System</h3>
                <p>This project leverages the immutability of blockchain technology to create a secure and tamper-proof system for verifying documents. By utilizing smart contracts, it ensures that once a document is verified, it cannot be altered, providing a reliable way for institutions and organizations to authenticate documents. This system is particularly useful for educational certificates, legal documents, and any scenario where authenticity is critical.</p>

                <h3>Raga Prediction and Analysis using Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>This innovative project explores the intersection of music and technology by applying machine learning algorithms to predict and analyze musical ragas. The system can identify patterns in audio files and match them to known ragas, offering musicians and researchers a tool to deepen their understanding of classical music. It also includes features for visualizing raga structures and analyzing their use in various compositions.</p>

                <h3>Blockchain-based Crowdfunding Platform</h3>
                <p>Designed to provide a transparent and secure platform for crowdfunding, this project utilizes blockchain to track contributions and ensure that funds are used as intended. The platform offers potential backers peace of mind by allowing them to see where their money is going, while project creators benefit from the trust that blockchain brings. Smart contracts automate the release of funds based on milestones, reducing the risk for both parties.</p>
